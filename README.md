# DiceRoller

This is my dice roller app. 

In order to utilize the app as it stands, download and install the apk file found in the same folder as this ReadMe on your android device. 



As it stands it has the following features:

-buttons to roll die of the following types: d4, d6, d8, d10, d%(100), d12, and d20

-currently shows up to 6 results of any individual die roll

-as an anti-cheat feature, text will indicate which die is cast with the results

-a timer was added to create a dynamic ease of use function. As it stands, if a die roll is executed within 1 second of the previous(max 6 rolls), an additionally roll of the same kind of die will result.

-any rolls after the previous second of execution will begin a new list of results


Intended improvements:

-allow for adaptation when device is rotated 90 degrees

-create an easily accessed history of rolls with time stamp

-create an options menu in order to allow use to customize thier experience
